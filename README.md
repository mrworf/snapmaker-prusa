# Snapmaker 2.0 - Prusa Slicer Profiles

This repo contains prusa slicer profiles specifically made to be used by Snapmaker 2.0 3D printers.

Since I own an A250 myself, expect that to be the main focus. Should you own a 150 or 350, feel free to
adapt them to work on your machine. I will not make them since I cannot verify them.

Also, I have the SM2.0 enclosure as well which might impact your prints if you don't. Have not tested to
see if that makes a big difference. Feel free to let me know.

# Profiles

If you add additional profiles, please add them to this section

## A250-PETG

PETG support, not the fastest profile, but produces reliable prints.

Be careful though, the PETG will stick hard to your bed if you leave it there to cool off!
